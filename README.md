## Documentation

[This blog post](https://l9o.dev/posts/controlling-an-elegoo-mars-pro-remotely/)
explains the setup end to end with pictures of the modifications done to
an Elegoo Mars Pro.

Alternatively, the documentation is hosted on this repository itself:

* **[Installing](docs/install.md)**: how to setup mariner on a Raspberry
  Pi Zero W and an Elegoo Mars Pro. These same instructions have been
  confirmed to work with the printers listed on the section above.
* **[Contributing](docs/contributing.md)**: how to setup your development
  environment and contribute to the project. Pull requests are welcome!
