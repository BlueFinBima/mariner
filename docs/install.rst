Installation Guide
==================

This document will guide you through the process of setting up mariner with
your printer: from the hardware setup, installing the mariner software, and
setting up Linux to share files with the printer and use the serial port.

.. note::
   This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. There is no
   guarantee this will work on your printer, nor that it won't damage it.  Use
   at your own risk.

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* One of the `supported 3D Printers <https://github.com/luizribeiro/mariner#supported-printers>`_
* Micro USB to USB-A cable to connect between Pi and printer mainboard.
* Power Supply for the Pi, or a 12V to 5V converter to power it from
  printer's power supply.
