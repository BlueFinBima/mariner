Welcome to the mariner documentation!
=====================================

Mariner is a web interface for controlling MSLA 3D Printers based on `ChiTu
controllers <https://www.chitusystems.com/>`_. These are controllers commonly
used on 3D Printers by many brands such as Elegoo and Phrozen, making mariner
compatible with a wide range of printers.
