Requirements
============

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

* **Raspberry Pi Zero W**. Other Pi models that support USB OTG have been
  reported to work too, such as the RPi 4B. See Wikipedia's article about the
  `Raspberry Pi specifications
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Specifications>`_ for a list of
  which models support USB OTG.
* **A supported printer.** Most MSLA 3D printers with a ChiTu board should work.
  We keep a list of :ref:`tested 3D Printers <Supported Printers>` on our
  documentation.
* **Micro USB to USB-A cable** to connect between Pi and printer mainboard.
* **Power Supply for the Pi**, or a 12V to 5V converter to power it from
  printer's power supply. Some users have also have had success with using 5V
  pins from the printer mainboard itself. However, that sometimes creates issues
  with poor WiFi signal, making uploading files too slow.
* An hour or two and some basic Linux knowledge :-)
